# An Alfred time tracking workflow
=============================

A simple Alfred Workflow that helps me remember what I was doing.

## Installation
1. Create a .txt file
2. Download and install the workflow
3. Once installed, edit the PHP script, making sure the paths to the .txt file you created are correct

## Usage
Type `doing` followed by what you were doing, e.g. `doing Checking emails`

You can also add the number of minutes spent doing the tasks, e.g. `doing 15 Checking emails`
